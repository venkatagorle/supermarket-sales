 🛂 Supermarket Sales ETL Pipeline

 🚀 Project Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for supermarket sales data. It extracts data from Kaggle, processes it, and loads it into SQLite/PostgreSQL for analysis. Finally, it generates SQL-based reports** to derive business insights.

🎯 Key Features
👉 Extracts raw data from Kaggle  
👉 Cleans and transforms data into structured format  
👉 Loads data into SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL (cloud)
👉 Generates sales reports using SQL queries  
👉 Scalable for cloud deployment

🛠️ Installation & Setup

 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supermarket-etl-pipeline.git
cd supermarket-etl-pipeline
```
 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 3️⃣ Run the ETL Pipeline
 Step 1: Extract Data from Kaggle
```
python scripts/extract.py
```
> Downloads the dataset and saves it in the `data/` folder.  

 Step 2: Transform & Load Data
```
python scripts/transform_load.py
```
> Cleans the data and loads it into SQLite/PostgreSQL.  

 Step 3: Generate Sales Report
```
python scripts/reporting.py
```
> Runs SQL queries and prints insights like total sales per product line.  

📊 Sample SQL Query for Reporting
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_line, SUM(s.total) AS total_sales
FROM sales s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_line
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
> This helps analyze top-performing product categories in sales.  

☁️ Cloud Deployment (Optional)
If needed, this project can be deployed on Render using:  
👉 PostgreSQL for database  
👉 Apache Airflow for scheduling ETL jobs  
👉 Docker & Kubernetes for scalable deployment  

  Notes for Interviewers
🔹 This ETL pipeline is modular and extendable.  
🔹 It supports both local (SQLite) and cloud (PostgreSQL) databases.  
🔹 The SQL queries can be customized for different business needs.  
🔹 The code is structured for production-level deployment with CI/CD compatibility.  

 💡 Future Enhancements
🚀 Automate with Apache Airflow – Schedule daily data loads  
🚀 Visualize Data with Dashboards – Integrate Tableau/Looker 
🚀 Use AWS Lambda – For serverless ETL execution
